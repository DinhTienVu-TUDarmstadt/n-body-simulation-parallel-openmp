# N-Body Simulation (OpenMP & Barnes-Hut)

This project extends the naive N-Body simulation by introducing **parallel computing** using OpenMP and optimizing force calculations using the **Barnes-Hut algorithm**.

## 📝 Overview
- Parallelized the naive N-Body simulation with OpenMP.
- Implemented a **Quadtree** structure to group bodies and reduce computation complexity.
- Used the **Barnes-Hut algorithm** for efficient force calculation.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **Task 2**: Parallelizing the naive N-Body simulation.
- **Task 3**: Building the Quadtree structure.
- **Task 4**: Implementing the CPU-parallel Barnes-Hut N-Body simulation.
- **Task 5**: Detecting and modeling collisions.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### **🔧 Requirements**
- C++ compiler supporting OpenMP
- CMake (optional, for building)
